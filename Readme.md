# Programming Practice Questions (All Languages)

This repository contains fundamental programming practice questions in various languages. Covering variables, data types, control structures, loops, functions, and user input handling, these exercises will help you build a strong programming foundation.

---

## 1️⃣ Variables & Data Types
✅ **Store and Print Data**  
- Write a program that stores a name (string) and age (integer) and prints them.

✅ **Basic Arithmetic Operations**  
- Take two floating-point numbers and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

✅ **Check Even or Odd**  
- Define a boolean variable to check if a given number is even or not.

---

## 2️⃣ If-Else Statements
✅ **Check Number Type**  
- Take an integer input and check whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

✅ **Even or Odd Check**  
- Take a number as input and check whether it is even or odd.

✅ **Voting Eligibility**  
- Take age input from the user and check whether the user is eligible to vote (age >= 18).

✅ **Temperature Conditions**  
- Take temperature input from the user and check:
  - If temp > 30, print *"It's very hot!"*
  - If temp is between 10-30, print *"The weather is pleasant."*
  - If temp < 10, print *"It's very cold!"*

## 3️⃣ Switch Case
✅ **Weekday Finder**  
- Write a program that takes a week number (1-7) as input and prints the corresponding weekday (1 → Monday, 2 → Tuesday, etc.).

✅ **Basic Calculator**  
- Create a calculator program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and performs the operation using a switch-case statement.

---

## 4️⃣ Loops
✅ **For Loop Basics**  
- Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.

✅ **While Loop (Even Numbers)**  
- Write a `while` loop that prints only even numbers from 1 to 100.

✅ **Factorial Calculation**  
- Take a number as input and calculate its factorial.

✅ **Fibonacci Series**  
- Print the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci series.

---

## 5️⃣ Functions
✅ **Basic Arithmetic Operations in a Function**  
- Create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

✅ **Prime Number Check**  
- Create a function that checks whether a given number is prime or not.

---

## 6️⃣ User Input Handling
✅ **Formatted User Info**  
- Take name, age, and city as input and print a well-formatted output.

✅ **Temperature Conversion**  
- Take temperature input in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit using:
  
  `F = C × 9/5 + 32`
